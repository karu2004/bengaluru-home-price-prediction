"Bangalore Home Price Prediction with Linear Regression & Flask üè†üí°

Welcome to our project repository where we predict home prices in Bangalore using Linear Regression and Python Flask! This repository contains all the code and resources needed to build a predictive model for estimating home prices based on various features.

Features:
Linear Regression: We leverage the power of linear regression to model the relationship between home prices and predictor variables.
Python Flask: Our web application is built using Flask, a lightweight WSGI web application framework in Python, providing a simple yet powerful way to deploy our model.
Data Analysis: Explore the data, perform feature engineering, and visualize insights to better understand the dynamics of the Bangalore housing market.


Key Components:
Data Collection & Preprocessing: We gather and preprocess data, cleaning and preparing it for analysis.
Model Training: Utilizing Linear Regression, we train our model on the prepared dataset.
Web Deployment: Flask allows us to deploy our model as a web application, making it accessible for users to predict home prices on the go.
